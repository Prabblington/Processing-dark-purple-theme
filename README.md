# Processing-dark-purple-theme
The Processing IDE burns your retinas, this dulls the blow and looks aesthetically pleasing while making reading easy for those with dyslexia.

I couldn't find a dark theme for this IDE which helped my ability and efficiency to read, notes on what each group of
commands is in the "theme" file so if you're unhappy with some of these changes too, you can go and change it yourself
to suit your needs :)


===============  HOW TO USE ===============

1) Find where install folder is located, e.g. C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\processing-3.5.4-windows64\processing-3.5.4
2) Make a copy of all folders, put it on your desktop or something, somewhere easy to find incase doing anything in the future breaks the program
3) Copy all files in this repository
4) Paste them inside the "lib" folder, overwrite anything that needs to be overwritten
5) Hope you enjoy coding with this :)
